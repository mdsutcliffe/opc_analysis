Top-level folder is the expected working directory for all scripts/functions.

#### These scripts expect folders (not included) titled:
1. build -> .RData files that include intermediate variables. Generated because running some of the files takes a nontrivial amount of time.
2. data -> raw data files that include RSEM CSVs, overdispersion simulation results, etc.
3. external -> contains downloaded data from external sources and publications
4. plots -> contains generated PDF files of figure panels
